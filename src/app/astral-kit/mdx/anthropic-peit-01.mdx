## Setup

This tutorial offers two modes: reader (default) and interactive (**recommended**). For a hands-on experience, switch to interactive mode by ticking the "Interactive mode" box below and entering your API key. Don't worry, you can always change the default mode by clicking the gear icon at the top of each page.

<Settings />

## Lesson

This tutorial is built to reflect Claude's [Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post) structure.

The API can take several parameters:

1. Your prompt
2. The model name
3. Max tokens <Info>The maximum length of Claude's responses. [What are tokens?](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them)</Info>
4. Any optional additional parameters, such as temperature, system prompt, etc.

**Note:** Temperature correlates to the degree of variability in Claude's answer. Higher generates more creative responses, lower produces more predictable responses. For this tutorial, we have set the "temperature" to 0. In Chapter 8, we'll dive deeper into temperature.

Let's look a few examples of prompts sent to Messages API.

## Examples

Let's take a look at how Claude responds to some <Mark>correctly-formatted prompts</Mark>. Don't worry about how the answers are being generated.

<Playground
  user={`Hi Claude, how are you?`}
  assistant={`I'm doing well, thanks for asking! As an AI assistant, I don't have feelings in the same way humans do, but I'm functioning properly and ready to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have. How can I help you today?`}
  labels={{ user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}
/>

**Tips for interactive mode**:

1. Click the "Run" button to send a message to Claude
2. You can switch between reader and interactive mode on any playground - just click on "Reader Mode" or "Interactive Mode" to toggle between the two.

<Playground
  user={`Can you tell me the color of the ocean?`}
  assistant={`The color of the ocean can vary depending on a few factors:

- Depth - The ocean appears blue in deeper waters due to the way sunlight interacts with the water molecules. Shallower waters may appear more green, turquoise, or even brown depending on the seafloor.

- Suspended particles - Things like plankton, sediment, or algae in the water can affect the ocean's color, making it appear more green, brown, or even reddish.

- Weather conditions - The sky's color can reflect on the surface of the ocean, making it appear more gray, white, or even black on overcast days.

- Geographic location - Different regions of the ocean can have slightly different hues based on factors like latitude, currents, and local marine life.

In general though, the predominant color of the open ocean is a deep, rich blue. This is due to the way sunlight interacts with the water and the lack of suspended particles in the deeper parts of the ocean. But the ocean's color can definitely vary quite a bit depending on the specific conditions.`}
labels={{ user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}

**Note:** Claude's response may be much longer than it appears. To view the full response, scroll down the text box.

<Playground
  user={`What year was Celine Dion born in?`}
  assistant={`Celine Dion was born on March 30, 1968.`}
  labels={{ user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}
/>

Now let's take a look at some <Mark>prompts that do not include the correct formatting</Mark>. For these malformatted prompts, the API returns an error. Here's a prompt that's missing user role.

<Playground
  assistant={`{
  "type": "invalid_request_error",
  "message": "messages.0.role: Input should be 'user' or 'assistant'"
}`}
  prompt={[{ role: '', content: 'What year was Celine Dion born in?' }]}
  labels={{ user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}
/>

Here's a prompt that fails to alternate between the User and Assistant roles.

<Playground
  assistant={`{
  "type": "invalid_request_error",
  "message": "messages: roles must alternate between \"user\" and \"assistant\", but found multiple \"user\" roles in a row"
}`}
  prompt={[
    { role: 'user', content: 'What year was Celine Dion born in?' },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Also, can you tell me some other facts about her?',
    },
  ]}
  labels={{ user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}
/>

Here's a prompt that starts with an "Assistant".

<Playground
  assistant={`{
  "type": "invalid_request_error",
  "message": "messages: first message must use the \"user\" role"
}`}
  prompt={[
    { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello! I’m Claude.' },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'What year was Celine Dion born in?',
    },
  ]}
  labels={{ user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}
/>

**"User" and "Assistant" messages MUST <Mark>alternate</Mark>**, and messages <Mark>MUST start with a "User:" turn</Mark>.

You can <Mark>use a system prompt to give Claude instructions and guidelines</Mark>. A system prompt is a way to **provide context, instructions, and guidelines to Claude** before presenting it with a question or task in the "User" turn.

Structurally, system prompts exist separately from the list of User & Assistant messages, and thus belong in a separate "system prompt" parameter.

<Playground
  system={`Your answer should always be a series of critical thinking questions that further the conversation (do not provide answers to your questions). Do not actually answer the user question.`}
  user={`Why is the sky blue?`}
  assistant={`Here are some critical thinking questions to further explore why the sky is blue:

- What causes the sky to appear blue in color?
- How does the composition of the Earth's atmosphere contribute to the sky's blue appearance?
- What role do the wavelengths of visible light play in making the sky appear blue?
- How do the scattering properties of different wavelengths of light affect the sky's color?
- What other factors, such as the time of day or weather conditions, can influence the sky's appearance?
- How have scientists historically explained and studied the phenomenon of the blue sky?
- What are some alternative perspectives or theories that have been proposed to explain the sky's blue color?

By exploring these types of questions, we can delve deeper into the scientific principles and mechanisms that give rise to the familiar blue hue of the sky.`}
labels={{ system: 'System Prompt', user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}
/>

**Why use a system prompt?** A well-written system prompt can improve Claude’s performance in a variety of ways, such as increasing Claude's ability to follow rules and instructions.

## Exercises

### Counting to Three

Using proper User/Assistant formatting, <Mark>write a prompt</Mark> below to <Mark>get Claude to count to three</Mark>.

Remember, if your answer is correct (which means formatting and prompt is good), you will see a green check mark in the top-right of Claude's response.

<Playground
  user={`Count to 3.`}
  assistant={`1, 2, 3.`}
  labels={{ user: 'Prompt', assistant: "Claude's Response" }}
  exercise={{ eval: '01-counting-to-three', answers: ['user'] }}
/>

<Details>
  <summary>If you need a hint, click me.</summary>

Provide a short instruction that asks Claude to <Mark>count to three</Mark>.

The exercise accepts an answer containing the numbers "1", "2", and "3" in that exact order, even if they are written in a different language or script, such as "一", "二", and "三" in Chinese.

If you're stuck, you can always switch to **READER MODE** to see the solution.

### System Prompt

Modify <Mark>the **system prompt**</Mark> to make Claude <Mark>respond like it's a 3 year old child</Mark>.

<Playground
  system={`Write like you're a 3 year old child.`}
  user={`How big is the sky?`}
  assistant={`da sky is SOOO big! it's like, waaaay up dere! you can't even see da end of it! it's blue and fluffy and has lotsa clouds in it. i wanna jump up and touch da sky, but i can't reach it. it's too high up! da sky is just so big and pretty, i wanna stare at it all day!`}
  labels={{
    system: 'System Prompt',
    user: 'Prompt',
    assistant: "Claude's Response",
  }}
  exercise={{ eval: '01-system-prompt', answers: ['system'] }}
/>

<Details>
  <summary>If you need a hint, click me.</summary>

There are many ways to solve this, just by asking! The exercise accepts a wide range of answers, as long as they sound like something a child would say.

As a reminder, you can switch to **READER MODE** to see the solution.
