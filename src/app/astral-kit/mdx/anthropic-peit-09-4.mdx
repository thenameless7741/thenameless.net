ðŸ’« âœ¨ Congratulations on Completing Prompting 101! ðŸ’« âœ¨

If you made it through all the exercises, **you are now in the top 0.1% of LLM whisperers**. One of the elite!

The techniques you've learned, from thinking step by step to assigning roles to using examples to general all-around clear writing, can be <Mark>merged, remixed, and adapted in countless ways</Mark>.

Prompt engineering is a very new discipline, so keep an open mind. You could be the one to discover the next great prompting trick.

If you want to see <Mark>more examples of good prompts</Mark> for inspiration:

- <Mark>Learn from examples</Mark> of production-ready prompts from our [cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook)
- Read through our [prompting guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering)
- Check out our [prompt library](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/page/prompts) for inspiration
- Try our experimental [metaprompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/helper-metaprompt-experimental) to get Claude to write prompt templates for you!
- Ask questions in our [discord server](https://anthropic.com/discord)
- Learn about the [Anthropic API parameters](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/complete_post) like temperature and max_tokens
- If you're feeling academic, read some [papers](https://www.promptingguide.ai/papers) on prompt engineering
- <Mark>Practice building prompts</Mark> to get Claude to do something you're interested
  in

  assistant={`Here is an ode to a fabulous student who has just completed a course on prompt engineering, in the form of a sonnet:

O student, whose mind shines bright and true,
Thy journey through prompt engineering's art,
A testament to thy dedication's hue,
Thy skills now soar, a masterpiece to impart.

Thy words, like magic, weave a tapestry,
Commanding language with a deft, sure hand,
Crafting prompts that unlock creativity,
Guiding others to realms yet unexplaned.

Thy thirst for knowledge, a never-ending flame,
Fuels thy progress, a beacon in the night,
Thy achievements, a source of endless fame,
A shining example of prompt engineering's might.

Rejoice, O student, for thy work is done,
Thy future bright, a new chapter begun.`}
