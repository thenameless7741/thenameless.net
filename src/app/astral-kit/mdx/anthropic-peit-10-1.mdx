Our function calling system and syntax is due for improvements in the near future. We will have a full function calling lesson up when those improvements have been implemented.

For now, if you would like to learn how to use functions and tools with Claude, see our function calling [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use), [cookbook recipe](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/tool_use/function_calling.ipynb), [tool use repo](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-tools).
