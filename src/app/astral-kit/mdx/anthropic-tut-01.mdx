## What is tool use?

Tool use, also known as function calling, refers to the ability to extend Claude's capabilities by defining and invoking external tools or functions. We can give Claude access to a set of predefined tools that it can invoke at any point.  Tools allow us to write code that can perform specific tasks or computations that Claude wouldn't be able to do otherwise. In short: tool use is a way of enhancing Claude's functionality.

## How tool use works

Let's turn our attention to how tool use actually works. The most important thing to understand up front is that Claude isn't *running* any code on its own.  We tell Claude about a set of tools it can ask us to call, and then it's our job to actually run the underlying tool code and tell Claude about the results.

Note that Claude does not have access to any built-in server-side tools. All tools must be explicitly provided by you, the user, in each API request. This means that you define the available tools, with clear descriptions and input schemas, as well as implements and executes the tool logic, such as running a specific function or querying an API at Claude's request. This gives you full control and flexibility over the tools Claude can use.

**TODO: IMAGE**

Specifically, using tools with Claude involves the following steps:

1. **Provide Claude with tools and a user prompt:** (API request)
    * Define the set of tools you want Claude to have access to, including their names, descriptions, and input schemas.
    * Provide a user prompt that may require the use of one or more of these tools to answer, such as "How many shares of General Motors can I buy with $500?"

2. **Claude uses a tool:** (API response)
    * Claude assesses the user prompt and decides whether any of the available tools would help with the user's query or task. If so, it also decides which tool(s) to use and with what input(s).
    * Claude outputs a properly formatted tool use request.
    * The API response will have a `stop_reason` of `tool_use`, indicating that Claude wants to use an external tool.

3. **Extract tool input(s), run code, and return results:** (API request)
    * On the client side, you should extract the tool name and input(s) from Claude's tool use request.
    * Run the actual tool code on the client side.
    * Return the results to Claude by continuing the conversation with a new user message containing a `tool_result` content block.

4. **Claude uses the tool result to formulate a response:** (API response)
    * After receiving the tool results, Claude will use that information to formulate its final response to the original user prompt.

Steps (3) and (4) are optional — for some workflows, Claude using the tool is all the information you need, and you might not need to return tool results back to Claude. More on that in a later chapter.

### Hypothetical tool use scenario

To better understand the flow of tool use, let's imagine that we are building a chat application that allows users to talk to Claude about the stock market and retrieve current stock prices.

Of course, Claude doesn't know what stock market conditions and prices are at any given point in time, so we need to provide Claude with a `get_stock_price` tool that retrieves the current stock price for a company.

Here's a simple diagram showing the flow of information between our app and Claude:

**TODO: IMAGE**

### Detailed breakdown of the process

Below is a detailed breakdown of the tool use steps

#### Step 0: Write the tool functionality

Before we tell Claude about a particular tool it has access to, we need to first write the functionality of that tool.  In the case of our `get_stock_price` tool, we would likely write a function that expects a company name or stock ticker as an argument and then sends a request to a stock market API to get live stock data.  Something like this:

```python
def get_stock_price(company):
    #Send a request to a stock market API to lookup current stock price for a given company

    #Returns a dictionary containing current stock price information for the specified company
```

If this function were fully implemented and we were to call it with `get_stock_price("General Motors")` we might get a return value that looks like this:


```json
{
  "symbol”: “GM”,
  "price”: 43.09
}
```

#### Step 1: Provide Claude with tools and a user prompt (API request)
Next, we need to define the `get_stock_price` tool with its name, description, and input schema.  We'll spend more time on defining tools later, but here's a hypothetical `get_stock_price` tool definition we could tell Claude about:


```python
tool_definition = {
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "description": "Retrieves the current stock price for a given company",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "company": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The company name to fetch stock data for"
            }
        },
        "required": ["company"]
    }
}
```

Next, we would tell Claude that this tool exists and make a request with a prompt that might require this tool:

```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "How many shares of General Motors can I buy with $500?"}],
    max_tokens=500,
    tools=[tool_definition]
)
```

#### Step 2: Claude uses a tool (API response)

Claude receives the API request and assesses the user prompt. It determines that the `get_stock_price` tool would be helpful in answering the question about buying shares of General Motors.

Claude responds with a properly formatted tool use request.  We'll dive deeper into this later, but here's an example response from Claude indicating that it "wants" to use our tool:

```json
{
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "tool_use": {
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "input": {
      "company": "General Motors"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Extract tool input, run code, and return results (API request)

On the client side, we extract the tool name (`get_stock_price`) and input company name (`General Motors`) from Claude's tool use request.

We execute the actual `get_stock_price` function that gets live stock market data from an API using the inputs extracted from Claude’s tool request. The function might return data that looks like this:

#### Step 4: Claude uses tool result to formulate a response (API response)

Claude receives the stock price tool result and incorporates the live stock market information into its final response to the original user prompt, finally responding back with something like:

>It looks like with a current share price of $43.09, you can buy around 11 shares of General Motors stock with your $500.
